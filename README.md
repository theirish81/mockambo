# Mockambo
## API Mocking, recording and Validation
Mockambo is an API mocking server that packs a lot of useful features to:
* generate mocked APIs on the fly based on **OpenAPI specifications** without additional configuration
* Validate requests and responses against the contract
* Fake data coherently
* Script the behavior of the mocks using JavaScript
* Load dynamic templates to make the mocks **even more *alive***
* Work as a **reverse proxy** request/response **recorder and playback**

All this by simply altering the OpenAPI specification, adding the `x-mockambo` extension sections where necessary.

Mockambo is a powerful *Swiss Army knife* for the following activities:
* Design first API development
* 3rd party API exploration and client development
* Service isolation during development and testing
* Contract testing of both clients and servers
* Offline development
* CI/CD pipeline testing
